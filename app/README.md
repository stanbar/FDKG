# v2v private voting

Voter to voter private voting app.

How do I prove that?
I would have to create simulations which shows when the election is stuck and when it's solveable
Which parameters I can modify?


1. 3 < |P| < 1_000_000

2. A priori trust network
- Web of trust (who choses who)
- Random
- Propabilistic Duplication

3. D \in P
|P| - Total number of participants

D - Participants in FDKG 
G - Guardian sets
  - Web of trust (who choses who)
  - Random
  - Konor's method

1 < k - guardian set size
1 < t < k - threshold
|V| <= |P| - Number of participants in voting -> it doesn't change the "security" it just influence performance

T < D - Participants in Tally
