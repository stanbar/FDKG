# Federated Distributed Key Generation (FDKG)

## Overview

**Title:** Federated Distributed Key Generation

**Abstract:** Distributed Key Generation (DKG) is vital to threshold-based cryptographic protocols such as threshold signatures, secure multiparty computation, and i-voting. Yet, standard \((n,t)\)-DKG requires a known set of \(n\) participants and a fixed threshold \(t\), making it impractical for public or decentralized settings where membership and availability can change.

We introduce Federated Distributed Key Generation (FDKG), which relaxes these constraints by allowing each participant to select its own guardian set, with a local threshold to reconstruct that participant's partial key. FDKG generalizes DKG and draws inspiration from Federated Byzantine Agreement, enabling dynamic trust delegation with minimal message complexity (two rounds). The protocol's liveness can tolerate adversary that controls up to \(k - t + 1\) nodes in every guardian set. The paper presents a detailed protocol, a formal description of liveness, privacy, and integrity properties, and a simulation-based evaluation showcasing the efficacy of FDKG in mitigating node unreliability.

In a setting of 100 parties, a 50% participation rate, 80% retention, and 40 guardians, the distribution phase incurred a total message size of 332.7 kB (\(O(n\,k)\)), and reconstruction phase 416.56 kB (\(O(n\,k)\)). Groth16 client-side proving took about 5 s in the distribution phase and ranged from 0.619 s up to 29.619 s in the reconstruction phase.

Our work advances distributed cryptography by enabling flexible trust models for dynamic networks, with applications ranging from ad-hoc collaboration to blockchain governance.
