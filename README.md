# PeerVote: A voter-to-voter voting protocol

Internet voting is essential in today's digital democracy, yet the landscape of Internet voting is dominated by centralised servers, costly public blockchains or private networks.
This poses a challenge for small organisations looking for a secure, cost-effective tool for democratic decision-making. 
This paper introduces PeerVote, an Internet voting protocol designed to address these challenges by providing a secure voting mechanism without the need for trusted third parties. 
PeerVote uses Federated Distributed Key Generation (FDKG) to improve resilience to node unavailability and introduces a flexible trust model, providing small organisations with a viable tool for promoting democratic engagement.
