#### Ballot
The word “ballot” derives from the Italian “ballotta.” Small colored balls (like peas or beans) were first used for secret voting in Italy in mid 16th century. Here, we use “ballot” as a shorthand for “voted ballot,” which literally means “a sheet of paper filled out to cast a secret vote.” Source: [[@schoenmakersLectureNotesCryptographic2018]].
