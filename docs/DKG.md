### Distributed Encryption Key Generation

Once the network is established nodes execute the first MPC functionality $F_1$, which lets nodes jointly compute $\textrm{PK} \equiv \textrm{SK} * g$, without reconstructing $\textrm{SK}$ on any single device. This is achieved using Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) or Distributed Key Generation (DKG) schemes [@gennaroSecureDistributedKey2007; @boldyrevaThresholdSignaturesMultisignatures2003].

Symbolically, the functionality $F_1$ is defined as follows: $$F_1(\mathrm{SK}_1, ..., \mathrm{SK}_N) = DerivePubKey(DKG(\mathrm{SK}_1, ..., \mathrm{SK}_N)) \rightarrow PK$$
The reconstruction of a $\textrm{SK}$ is possible only if a sufficient number of votes (predefined threshold) collude. It would require executing malicious functionality $F_m(\mathrm{SK}_1, ..., \mathrm{SK}_N)=DerivePrivKey(\mathrm{SK}_1, ..., \mathrm{SK}_N) \rightarrow \textrm{SK}$. The situation should not happen under the honest majority assumption.Â
