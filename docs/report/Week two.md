# Results

This week we:
- Chatted with Shashank
- Clarified the goal of our protocol
- Decided to focus on 1-2 use cases and do them better than anyone else
- Prepared the [[Development]] roadmap
- Getting closer to the development phase


# Challenges and open questions

What part of our protocol can be done off-chain, and what needs to be done on-chain? What is the trade-off?

What platform to use? 
A web app would be ideal, but it may me a lot of work, therefore building CLI PoC first may be a better option.
