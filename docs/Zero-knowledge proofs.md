We use two zero knowledge proofs in our protocol. 
1. The first one we call [[PoB - Proof of Ballot]] which attest to the correctness of the encrypted ballot during the [[Round 2. Voting]].
2. The second one we call [[PoD - Proof of Decryption]] which attest to the correctness of decryption during the [[Round 3. Tally]].
