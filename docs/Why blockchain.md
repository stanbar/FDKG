We need BC for achieving common knowledge of all votes, aka. bulletin board.

BC does not need to be public. We can deploy distributed network on voters' smartphones. It has to support:
-   minimum 3 blocks 1. register, 2. voting, 3. results;
-   need to be able to achieve consensus;
-   need to send transactions;

It does **not** need to support
-   EVM or any other smart contract VM.
